# Cursor Page Clone

This project is a pixel-perfect replica of the [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) landing page, built using **only HTML and CSS**. It focuses on modern SaaS web design principles, featuring a clean layout, semantic HTML structure, and a custom dark mode aesthetic with monospace typography.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to verify the potential of raw HTML/CSS without relying on frameworks like React, Tailwind, or Bootstrap. It replicates the structure, styling, and visual hierarchy of the original site.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) for better accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS3**:
  - **Variables (`:root`)**: For consistent colors, spacing, and typography management.
  - **Flexbox & Grid**: For complex layouts (testimonials, feature rows, footer).
  - **Monospace Typography**: A technical, developer-focused aesthetic.
  - **Zero Frameworks**: 100% custom styling.
